## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Umer Ahmed, a dedicated microbiologist currently pursuing an MPhil in Microbiology at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. My research focuses on drug resistance profiling, microbial identification, and disease surveillance, with a special interest in E. coli and targeted antimicrobial therapies in the poultry industry. Iâ€™m passionate about finding solutions to the growing problem of drug-resistant pathogens.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on drug resistance profiling in E. coli isolates from poultry and Executive Board Member at MicroInformatics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m enhancing my skills in molecular diagnostics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics for Empowering Biotech Students & Researchers.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to microbiology, biotechnology, and veterinary science.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking guidance and collaboration opportunities in antimicrobial resistance and microbiome research.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about E. coli drug resistance, poultry disease diagnostics, or techniques like PCR and DNA extraction.
